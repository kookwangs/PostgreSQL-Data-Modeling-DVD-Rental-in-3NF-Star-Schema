# PostgreSQL-Data-Modeling-DVD-Rental-in-3NF-Star-Schema
Designed and transformed the DVD Rental database from **3NF** to a **Star Schema** in **PostgreSQL** to optimize query performance. Gained hands-on experience with PostgreSQL, **pgAdmin**, **CLI commands**, and data import processes. Learned from Darshil Parmarâ€™s YouTube channel, which covered database setup, design decisions, and best practices for structuring relational data.

## DVD Rental Dataset



[The DVD Rental Database](https://neon.tech/postgresql/postgresql-getting-started/postgresql-sample-database) is a sample dataset used to demonstrate PostgreSQL features. It models the business operations of a DVD rental store, including inventory management, customer rentals, payments, and store operations.

The database consists of 15 tables: actor, film, film_actor, category, film_category, store, inventory, rental, payment, staff, customer, address, city, and country.

The relationships between these tables are shown in the ER diagram above.
